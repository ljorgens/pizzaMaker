Personal assessment week 7
READ ME! Hello fellow developer!

This read me will give you a better understanding of my pizza maker project and my website.

Setup

This Setup will only be for MACs because I dont know how to do it for Windows, Sorry PC users!

Specs: I am using Mac OSX yosemite 10.10.1 and the text editor Sublime text 2 along with the terminal using jquery 1.11.2 and Safari web browser

Create a folder called pizza-company and copy the folders and names of the files in my repository into it.

You now should have a pizza-company folder with three folders and one file (not including the README). 

Make sure js has two files, spec has 5 and css has 1 with all the right endings.

To begin you will need to click on the pizz-company.html and open it up in your favorite brower (I used safari but it should work in most).

You are ready to go! You should now be able to enter what type of pizza you want and get the price and slice number back!
